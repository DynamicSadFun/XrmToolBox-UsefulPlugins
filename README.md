# 🧩 Power Platform vs XrmToolBox: Feature Comparison Table

Welcome to this community-driven comparison between the native capabilities of the **Power Platform** (via [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com)) and the extended tooling available through the **[XrmToolBox](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/)** ecosystem.

While Microsoft has built an amazing low-code platform, many tasks — especially those related to ALM, governance, and bulk operations — are still much easier (or only possible) using free tools made by the Power Platform community.

🔎 This repo aims to highlight the **strengths of XrmToolBox** and show **where it fills gaps** in the native Maker Portal.
